"""
This code snippet initializes variables and objects for data processing and modeling. It imports the Dataset class from the data module and creates an instance of it. The variables d, t, degree, unit, epoch, batch_size, p_arima, d_arima, q_arima, is_auto, min_scale, max_scale, model, model1_selected, combine, and combine_strategy are all set to None or default values. 

This code snippet serves as a starting point for data analysis and modeling tasks, allowing for customization of various parameters and settings.
